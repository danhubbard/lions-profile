          <p class="mb-3">Hi, British & Irish Lions digital team</p>

          <p class="mb-3">I’m Dan, a Product Maker and Manager and rugby enthusiast. I saw your LinkedIn ad for a Digital Product Manager and I couldn’t help but do something more than submit a CV to apply.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">A bit about me... After a degree in Computer Science I started out as a developer in a digital agency, building campaigns, websites and products for a wide range of clients in FMCG, Gaming and e-commerce.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">I got curious about better ways of building software and my interest in agile methods began, convincing senior management to try some new ways of working with our clients.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">From there I wanted to learn what to build, as well as how, and joined a technology-focused management consultancy. I built a team of 16 developers, established working practices and found myself in what is now known as product management, leading digital engagements with clients as varied as day one startups through to household names like M&S.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">Rugby has been a huge part of my life as long as I can remember. From watching six nations weekends on BBC with my Dad, playing from the age of 11 and coaching youth sides at my local club. Today, Leicester Tigers games reunite my family a few times a year. </p>

          <p class="mb-3">I’ve long felt that British sports generally, and rugby in particular, has a huge opportunity to take advantage of digital in fan engagement especially. The 1997 'Living with Lions' documentary stands out as something completely new, and I think innovative for its time. I believe there's a real opportunity to do something similar with digital today.</p>

          <p class="mb-3">The celing is so high, and the chance to take this challenge on in a role like this with the Lions is something that gets me incredibly excited - it's not often you see an opportunity to combine two passions like this. </p>

          <p class="mb-3">There’s lots more detail about my career in my CV, which you can <a class="text-[#af001e] font-bold" href="dan-hubbard-cv.pdf">download here</a> and tonnes more I’d love to talk about - things I’ve done, and ideas I have - but I hope I’ve managed to convince you to at least start a conversation with this! </p>

            <h2 class="font-dincon text-4xl uppercase text-[#af001e] mb-2">Lions Origin Clubs <span class="text-gray-300">(Some things I've done)</span></h2>
            <p class="mb-8">(This is non-exhaustive, much more detail is in my <a class="text-[#af001e] font-bold" href="dan-hubbard-cv.pdf">CV</a> and I have other examples I'd be happy to talk through too.)</p>
